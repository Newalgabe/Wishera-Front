    "faqs": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "How does the gift reservation system work?",
        "answer": "When someone views your wishlist, they can reserve a gift without you seeing who reserved it. This prevents duplicate gifts while keeping the surprise intact. You'll only see that an item has been reserved, not who reserved it."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Is my wishlist private?",
        "answer": "You have full control over your wishlist privacy. You can make it public with a shareable link, private for invited friends only, or completely private for your eyes only. Your privacy settings can be changed at any time."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Can I add images to my wishlist items?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can upload images for each wishlist item using our Cloudinary integration. This helps others see exactly what you want and makes your wishlist more visually appealing."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How do I share my wishlist with friends?",
        "answer": "Simply click the 'Share' button on your wishlist to generate a unique link. You can then send this link to friends and family via email, text, or social media. They can view your wishlist without needing to create an account."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "What happens when someone reserves a gift?",
        "answer": "When someone reserves a gift, it's marked as 'Reserved' on your wishlist. This prevents others from buying the same item. The person who reserved it can see their reserved items in their account, but you won't know who reserved what."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Can I edit or remove items from my wishlist?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! You can edit any item on your wishlist at any time. You can change the name, description, price, image, or remove items completely. Changes are reflected immediately for anyone viewing your wishlist."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "Is there a limit to how many items I can add?",
        "answer": "Currently, there's no limit to the number of items you can add to your wishlist. Add as many items as you'd like, from small stocking stuffers to big-ticket items."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "How secure is my account and data?",
        "answer": "We take security seriously. All data is encrypted, passwords are securely hashed, and we use industry-standard security measures. We never share your personal information with third parties without your consent."
